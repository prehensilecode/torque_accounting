* Handle datetime.timedelta properly so that -ve timedeltas don't
  give nonsensical discrepancies like -1day...

  - see http://docs.python.org/2.6/library/datetime.html
    This is due to normalization to ensure that days, seconds, and microseconds
    remain within limits:

        0 <= microseconds < 1000000
        0 <= seconds < 3600*24 (the number of seconds in one day)
        -999999999 <= days <= 999999999

    so timedelta(microseconds=-1) -> days=-1, seconds=86399, microseconds=999999
